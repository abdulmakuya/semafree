Ema is an expecting lady attending the maternity clinic,She went to a hospital in the city,and received a really poor customer service,adding to the disrespectful replies from the attending nurse. 

This happens in so many areas in the country,from public institutions,government agencies,corporates and so forth.with claims ranging from upcountry buses overspeeding,to very slow bankteller windows and so forth.

Ironically the management needs to hear this from their customers,the customers need to give their feedback to whoever that can attend the situation but there is a gap.

## Challenges we are trying to adress
- The right channel:In most of the time,the top level management is very willing to receive feedback and complaints,but the people do not know the right channels to reach to it
- No loop feedback:In order to nurture the culture of people giving feedback,you need to get them aware that their complaints or suggestations have been received and they will reached back whenever it would be necessary for further clarification.
- Timely response:Unlike the conventional method,of a box placed on the wall.the digitized process assures timely delivery to the management level.
- All in one pack convinience:Although some providers provide hotline numbers,not everybody wants to save 50 numbers of their service providers.
