## Problems
- The right channel:In most of the time,the top level management is very willing to receive feedback and complaints,but the people do not know the right channels to reach to it
- No loop feedback:In order to bring the culture of people giving feedback,you need to keep them posted..or getting them aware that their complaints or suggestation have been received and they will reached back whenever it would be necessary for further clarification.

### Rapid Prototyping

We used OnShape to design the 3D model, and 3D priting to print the prototype [prototype](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/770dbdb6e5e5786d75164041/w/601f35e9fa386c2315229862/e/ac914ba21baa19614e4c4a59). You can find the STL file here and 3D print it yourself `fundidesk.stl`
